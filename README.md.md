# 🛡️ Unloved Supply Co — ISO 27001 ISMS Case Study

A complete ISO 27001–aligned Information Security Management System (ISMS) case study for **Unloved Supply Co**, developed by **Lars Holmstrom** to demonstrate practical Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) documentation and implementation skills.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

This workspace presents a **simulated but realistic ISMS implementation** for *Unloved Supply Co (USC)* — an independent Melbourne-based streetwear brand owned by Lars Holmstrom.  
It demonstrates how ISO/IEC 27001:2022 principles can be applied to a small, cloud-based e-commerce business.

The goal is to show **hands-on understanding of GRC frameworks**, including governance documentation, risk management, compliance mapping, and internal audit planning.
